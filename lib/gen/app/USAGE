app - Create a new SproutCore application target.

USAGE:

  sc-gen app AppName [--filename=FILENAME] [--target=TARGET_NAME] [--statechart]

DISCUSSION:

This generator will create a new SproutCore application for a particular
project.  You should pass as the first parameter your AppName you want to
create.  For example:

  sc-gen app Todos

This defines a new application called Todos in the file apps/todos/ .  Or you
can include a basic statechart for example:

  sc-gen app Todos --statechart

This defines a new application called Todos in the file apps/todos/ using
statecharts.  Within the apps/Todos/resources directory you will have a
statechart.js file and a states directory with the ready_state.js file.  The
statechart.js file sets the initial state of your app to ready.

As your app grows.  You will create new states within the statechart.js file.
In your states folder you will describe the states declared in the statechart.js.
