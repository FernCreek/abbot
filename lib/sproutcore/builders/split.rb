  # This builder is used to split packed CSS files, ironically enough,
  # into smaller CSS files. This is due to an IE limitation of ~4096 maximum
  # selectors per file.
  #
  # This is a bit hacky, but we add additional manifest entries even though, technically,
  # the manifest generation process is finished. We do this because we have NO WAY
  # of knowing how many selectors there will be until CSS is both built and packed.
  #
  # The static HTML helper makes sure to build! the packed stylesheet entries first so
  # that this rule has been processed. After that, it looks for [:split_entries] on the
  # packed entry.
