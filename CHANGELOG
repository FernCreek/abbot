*SproutCore 1.6.0.rc.1 (May 16, 2011)*

* DRY up the init task

* Added copyright_block method to centralize template copyright generation

* Fixed test name typos
* Try to load APP_NAME.js in addition to core.js - Fixes #413
* Updated haml and compass dependencies

* Less noisy RSpec
* Rakefile release task
* Add handlebars files to the entries
* fixed bug in the require of generated models
* Adding touch_enabled flag to avoid having the touch icons included (default is still true)
* Correct behavior of sc_require in Chance.
* Made modules SC.Objects instead of just hashes
* Fix to chance to avoid a Windows error
* Change jQuery.ready() to SC.ready() in HTML template, which allows SC.RootResponder to attach event listeners before the app runs.

* Adding timestamp to sc-build logger, thanks Tony Sung

*SproutCore 1.5.0.pre.4 (February 28, 2011)*

* We are beginning to move API that we don't believe will be ready before 1.5
release into the `experimental` framework. If your apps rely on code that is
migrated to experimental, please make sure you include it as a dependency. For
more, please see frameworks/experimental/README.md.
* Support for extending classes after they've been created with the
reopen()/enhance() combo. For more, see: [this
discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore-dev/browse_thread/thread/d65ad54d6fddef5d)
	* This change may break existing code if you call sc_super() in your mixins.
	If your app throws exceptions after updating, please see [this post](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore-dev/browse_thread/thread/cc6a97e6133cb8cc).
* Added SC.TemplateView and Handlebars. These allow you to specify the content
of your views using templates.
	* {{#view}} helper allows you to define child views
	* {{#bind}} helper allows you to render a property, and automatically update DOM if that
	property ever changes.
	* {{#collection}} helpers allows you to render a simple collection of items
	using templates
	* SC.TextFieldSupport and SC.CheckboxSupport mixins for SC.TemplateViews
	that wrap <input> elements.
* Split SC.View into units of functionality. SC.View remains functionally the
same, but you can now use SC.CoreView, a light-weight subset of SC.View.
* SC.ImageView will use a <canvas> tag on platforms that support it, which
improves performance significantly.
* SC.SegmentedView now creates an overflow menu if there are too many segments
to display.
	* Class names for SC.SegmentedView have been cleaned up. You may need to
	update your CSS if you were theming SC.SegmentedView.
* You can now observe the contents of enumerables using the special `@each`
key.
* Dependent keys can accept property paths. For example, you can say
.property('foo.bar'), and it will be invalidated if the `bar` property of
`foo` changes.
* Deprecated SC.viewportOffset(). Please use SC.offset() instead, which is
more explicit about what it returns.
* SC.browser now detects Android devices.
* SC.device.orientation now works reliably on desktop, iOS, and Android 2.1
and above.
* Experimental support for gyroscope information, if provided by the browser.
* Unit tests for runtime, desktop, foundation, core_foundation, and datastore
are all passing.
